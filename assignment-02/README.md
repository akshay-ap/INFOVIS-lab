# Asssignment 2

This folder contains all files for assignment 2.

## Folders and Files

| folder/file | contents |
| ------ | -------- |
| public | folder that contains all the data files, HTML files and CSS files |
| src    | folder that contains your application files |
| package.json | JSON file that contains some project metadata, lists all dependencies and contains scripts/commands for the project |
| package-lock.json | automatically generated by npm when any operation modifies the node_modules tree or the package.json file |
| rollup.config.js | the rollup configuration file that determines how your files are bundled |

## The Server

### Setup

1. Make sure npm is installed ([https://www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com))
2. Run `npm install` in the console
    - This downloads and installs all dependencies listed in the **package.json**, creating the **node_modules** folder in the process.

### Start

1. Run `npm run dev` in the console
2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Alternatively, you can also use a **launch.json** (example provided) to launch the server via VS Code
or run the npm command via the NPM SCRIPTS tab in the VS Code explorer.

### Shut down

* The nice way: use the `Ctrl+C` hotkey and confirm
* The not so nice way: kill the terminal where the server is running
